# Research Leads Report

**Root Person:** [{{ root_person_id }}]({{ root_person_id|person_url }})
**Focus Area:** {{ focus_area }}
**Generated:** {{ generated_at }}

## Prioritized Research Opportunities

The following persons are prioritized for source research based on:
- Proximity to root person (closer generations = higher priority)
- Number of vital facts (Birth, Death) without sources
- Number of important facts (Marriage, Residence) without sources

{% for item in priorities %}
### {{ loop.index }}. {{ item.person_name }} (Priority: {{ item.priority_score }})

**Person ID:** [{{ item.person_id }}]({{ item.person_id|person_url }})
**Generation:** {{ item.generation }} ({{ item.generation }} generations from root)
**Current Sources:** {{ item.total_sources }}
**Missing Vital Events:** {{ item.vital_missing }}
**Missing Important Events:** {{ item.important_missing }}

**Events Needing Sources:**
{% for event in item.missing_events %}
- {{ event }}
{% endfor %}

**Recommended Next Steps:**
{% if 'Birth' in item.missing_events %}
- Search birth/christening records in parish registers or civil registration
- Check for census records listing birth year and place
{% endif %}
{% if 'Death' in item.missing_events %}
- Search death certificates, burial records, or obituaries
- Check cemetery records via Find A Grave
{% endif %}
{% if 'Marriage' in item.missing_events %}
- Search marriage records in parish registers or civil registration
- Look for marriage banns or licenses
{% endif %}

**Suggested Collections:**
- FamilySearch Mexico Vital Records
- FamilySearch California Vital Records
- Chronicling America (for obituaries)
- Find A Grave Memorial Index

## General Research Strategy

1. **Start with the highest priority persons** (those closest to the root and with the most missing vital events)
2. **Focus on vital records first** (birth, death, marriage) as they establish identity and relationships
3. **Use multiple sources** to corroborate information and resolve conflicting data
4. **Document negative searches** to avoid repeating unsuccessful searches
5. **Look for collateral relatives** (siblings, cousins) who may have better documentation
